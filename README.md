# ArcheRage Addons

These are ArcheAge addons specifically created for the RU version of ArcheAge, found at https://ru.archerage.to/. 

They should be compatible with the NA version. They are not compatible (but usually with some effort can be ported) to Classic. AAFree/Official RU do not support Addons.

All addons should fall under acceptable use of the addon policy.


## Installation

Directly clone the repository into C:\ArcheRage\Documents\Addon or wherever your Addon folder is located. The "globals" folder is needed for all addons.

After that restart your client and enable the addons you need in character select:
