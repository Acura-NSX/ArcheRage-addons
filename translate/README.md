# In-game Automatic Translation tool

The **In-game Automatic Translation Tool** uses the Google Translate API to automatically translate all in-game chat. 
It supports translation to and from all languages supported by Google Translate (utilizing the API's language detection).

Change `local target_language = "en"` to change your target language (ru, zh, ...)

The command window has to remain open to maintain translations.

Contributions are welcome!
