# In-game Automatic Translation tool

The **In-game Automatic Translation Tool** uses the Google Translate API to automatically translate all in-game chat. 
It supports translation to and from all languages supported by Google Translate (utilizing the API's language detection).

Change `local target_language = "en"` to change your target language (ru, zh, ...)

At the moment, the tool spawns command windows, which may cause FPS drops. It serves as a promising proof of concept but is still very much a **work in progress**.

Contributions are welcome!
